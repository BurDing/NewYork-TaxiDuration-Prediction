Life pace is getting faster and faster. How to employ times precisely and correctly is a vital attribute for success. Traditionally, when it comes to measuring the time duration of a trip, features such as speed, distance dominate the major analyses. However in reality, there are still a myriad of variation that affect the duration significantly. In this study, we try to find hidden features to build a framework that can predict the trip duration, which include three major steps: (1) Feature engineering, (2) Feature analysis, (3) Model tuning.
